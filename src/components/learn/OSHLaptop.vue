            OpenSensorHub (OSH) is an open standards based, open source software platform that supports all manner of Sensors, Things, and Robots, and is built around the concepts of modular, reconfigurable, plug-and-play components. OSH offers a node based architecture, where each node can support one or more sensor/actuator systems and can be deployed anywhere from the Cloud to the Edge (e.g. Android device, sensor or platform, or Raspberry PI). OSH nodes deployed in the field can support a wide variety of connectivity protocols for sensor and actuator systems including IP, WiFi, RS232, Bluetooth, IPC, etc. OSH is built upon Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) sensor standards including the OGC SensorWebEnablement (SWE) and the emerging OGC API â€“ Connected Systems specification.
