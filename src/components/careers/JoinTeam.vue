            Our goal is for everyone on the Botts-Inc team to grow into being a world leader in the art and science of transforming Sensors, Things, and Robots into location-enabled, geographically-aware, webs accessible services.  While Botts-Inc is primarily interested in full-time hires, and places priority on Alabama based employees, we are looking for talented team players based anywhere and will consider non-full time relationships.
