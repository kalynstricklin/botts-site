      <p class="mt-4">
        We are working at the crossroads of the Internet of Things (IoT), robotics, and cloud computing to build a seamless fabric that interconnects all types of devices and connected systems in what we call the “Sensor Web”. Our open source-, open standards-based OpenSensorHub (OSH – www.OpenSensorHub.org) API, and our commercially supported “open core” GeoRoboitix SaaS/OnPrem solution, has the aim to improve how things get done in many sectors such as emergency response, smart cities, environmental monitoring, intelligence, and defense. We are a small but growing team where every member is vital. Come help us create the future now.
